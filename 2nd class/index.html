    <p>Khan was born in Lahore on 5 October 1952. Some reports suggest he was born on 25 November 1952.[50][51][52][53]
        It was reported that 25 November was wrongly mentioned by Pakistan Cricket Board officials on his passport.[54]
        He is the only son of Ikramullah Khan Niazi, a civil engineer, and his wife Shaukat Khanum, and has four
        sisters.[55] Long settled in Mianwali in northwestern Punjab, his paternal family are of Pashtun ethnicity and
        belong to the Niazi tribe,[56][57] and one of his ancestors, Haibat Khan Niazi, in the 16th century, "was one of
        Sher Shah Suri's leading generals, as well as being the governor of Punjab."[58] Like his father, Khan's mother
        was an ethnic Pashtun, who belonged to the Burki tribe and whose ancestors had been settled in the Jalandhar
        district of Punjab for centuries. Following the creation of Pakistan, she migrated to Lahore with the rest of
        Khan's maternal relatives.[59] Khan's maternal family has produced a number of cricketers, including those who
        have represented Pakistan,[55] such as his cousins Javed Burki and Majid Khan.[56] Maternally, Khan is also a
        descendant of the Sufi warrior-poet and inventor of the Pashto alphabet, Pir Roshan, who hailed from his
        maternal family's ancestral Kaniguram town located in South Waziristan in the tribal areas of northwest
        Pakistan.[60] His maternal family was based in Basti Danishmanda, Jalandhar, India for about 600 years.[61][62]

        A quiet and shy boy in his youth, Khan grew up with his sisters in relatively affluent, upper middle-class
        circumstances[63] and received a privileged education. He was educated at the Aitchison College and Cathedral
        School in Lahore,[64][65] and then the Royal Grammar School Worcester in England, where he excelled at cricket.
        In 1972, he enrolled in Keble College, Oxford where he studied Philosophy, Politics and Economics, graduating in
        1975.[66] An enthusiast for college cricket at Keble, Paul Hayes, was instrumental in securing the admission of
        Khan, after he had been turned down by Cambridge.[67]</p>

    <h2 id="Cricketcareer">Cricket career</h2>
    <p>Khan made his first-class cricket debut at the age of 16 in Lahore. By the start of the 1970s, he was playing for
        his home teams of Lahore A (1969–70), Lahore B (1969–70), Lahore Greens (1970–71) and, eventually, Lahore
        (1970–71).[68] Khan was part of the University of Oxford's Blues Cricket team during the 1973–1975 seasons.[66]

        He played English county cricket from 1971 to 1976 for Worcestershire. During this decade, other teams
        represented by Khan included Dawood Industries (1975–1976) and Pakistan International Airlines (1975–1976 to
        1980–1981). From 1983 to 1988, he played for Sussex.[17]</p>

    <p>After retiring, Khan remarked that there was ball tampering during his early cricketing days when playing
        domestic cricket. Khan had said that, during matches, he "occasionally scratched the side of the ball and lifted
        the seam." However, Khan defended his actions in the same</p>
